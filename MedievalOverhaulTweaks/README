These patches use the xml patching system of Rimworld, it will add a few milliseconds to the loading time. The only hard requirement is [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2023507013]Vanilla Expanded Framework[/url] which does the heavy lifting for hard patches.

[h3]Fixes[/h3]

[list]
[*] Workbench's recipe bills, it's possible to craft anything craftable in the crafting spot
[*] Tailor Bench's recipe bills to accept anything craftable in a Hand Tailor Bench

[*] Early [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2101545242&searchtext=medieval]Medieval Prosthetics[/url] is cheaper to research, this is still tied to the medieval era.
