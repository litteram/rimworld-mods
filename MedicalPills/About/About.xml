	<description>An add-on for √Årgon's Tribal Medicine mod. LOAD AFTER THAT MOD.
	
	- This mod allows you to create pills with the same effects as the Flu, Immunity, Curative and Digestive teas from the original mod.
	- Pills have the advantage of not giving a mood debuff. They can be made by combining a medical tea with 2 Neutroamine at the drug lab.
	- Require the "Pills" technology (1000 Industrial), which also require the Drug Production technology. Also changes the original herbal tea technology to 2000 neolithic science.
